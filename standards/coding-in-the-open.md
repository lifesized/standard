# Code in the open

## Measure: Code in the open

* All source code for any used policy and software not used for fraud detection MUST be published and publicly accessible.
* Any source code that is not currently in use, such as new versions, proposals or older versions SHOULD be published.
* Contributors MUST never upload sensitive information regarding users, the organization or third parties to the repository, for example: configurations, usernames and passwords, public keys and other real credentials used in the production system.
* The source code MAY provide the general public insight into which source code underpins any specific interaction they have with your organization.

## What coding in the open facilitates

* Transparency
* Better quality code
* Auditability

## What coding in the open does not do

* Make things reusable
* Make the codebase and the code inside it understandable to everyone

## How to test if coding is done in the open

* The current version of the source is published on the internet where it can be seen from outside the original contributing organization and without the need for any form of authentication

## Policy makers: what you need to do to code in the open
